#Trust

Trust is an application that allows users to play a game to test their trust into other individuals, with limited information.
In this game users can either choose to "Invest" an amount of currency and hope for a Trust bonus if their opponent also invests, or
"Cash out" to walk off with the pool of currency. The game consists of three rounds, that up the stakes each round.

Based on past decisions, the game creates an OCEAN personality profile of the users, as well as provide them with a Trust score.

# data

The game collects data on how users behave during the game, decide to invest based on previous encounters,
The game also collects data on decision psychology, like how long the user hesitated, or if they decided to invest more if
their opponent also decided to invest more.

## shortcomings

There's some issues with the way that data is structured, as well as how the game processes the data.
A lot more data could have been gathered on the game, but it's complexity made it difficult to analyse and troubleshoot the code.
As the project grew in complecity, so did the data it managed.

Besides gathering data, less time was spent on the styling and design of the application. This makes it hard for users to enjoy the game.

## what did i learn

while most of the project was coded with the help of Artificial Intelligence, i learned how to develop a mobile application
using React native and expo Go. Besides front-end development, i learned alot about what it takes to create an extensive backend for an application that uses alot of data. I learned more about code structures, conventions, networking, data flow...
