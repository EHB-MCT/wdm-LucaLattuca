#Trust

Trust is an application that allows users to play a game to test their trust into other individuals, with limited information.
In this game users can either choose to "Invest" an amount of currency and hope for a Trust bonus if their opponent also invests, or
"Cash out" to walk off with the pool of currency. The game consists of three rounds, that up the stakes each round.

Based on past decisions, the game creates an OCEAN personality profile of the users, as well as provide them with a Trust score.

# data

## shortcomings

There's some issues with the way that data is structured, as well as how the game processes the data.
alot more data could have been gathered on the game, but it's complexity made it difficult to analyse and troubleshoot everything.
